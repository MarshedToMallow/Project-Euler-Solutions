# Problem

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Solution

The trivial solution would simply be to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to 4 million and keep track of the sum of the event values.

An optimization to that is to keep in mind that only every 3rd value is even.
This is a result of: even + odd = odd, odd + odd = even, odd + even = odd,...

With that in mind, we can use the following algebra to determine how to take the previous two values (looking at every 3rd) to find the next one.

```
X is a fibonacci number, Y is the number 3 places after X, n is the value right after X

X, n, n + X, Y

2n + X = Y
2n = Y - X

Z is the value 3 places after Y, m is the value right after Y

X, n, n + X, Y, m, m + Y, Z

m = n + X + Y
2m = 2n + 2X + 2Y
2m = Y - X + 2X + 2Y
2m = X + 3Y

Z = m + m + Y
Z = 2m + Y
Z = X + 3Y + Y
Z = X + 4Y
```

So, as an example, let's take 2 and 8.

```
Z = X + 4Y
Z = 2 + 4(8)
Z = 2 + 32
Z = 34
```

1, **2**, 3, 5, **8**, 13, 21, **34**,...

So now we can implement that in our code to only visit the even values by staring with 2 and 8.
