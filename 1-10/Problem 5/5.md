# Problem

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positivenumber that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

# Solution

**Trivial**

Incrementing a test value until you reach the correct number isn't as practical since the result ends up being in the hundreds of millions.

**Collision Avoidance (Attempt 1)**

My initial approach was to start the product of 1 and multiply it by the prime factors it was missing from each number 1 to 20.
This ended up with a runtime of ~35 μs.

**Prime Initializing and Iterating (Attempt 2)**

Another approach I thought of was to start with a product of all the primes 1 to 20 then check if each number divides it.
Since all of the primes wouldn't divide anything that isn't a multiple of the product of the primes, so if all numbers don't evenly divide the product, simply increasing by the original product each time moves things along fairly quickly.
Average time is ~30 μs when initialized with the product of primes but is ~60 μs if it needs to find the primes itself.
