# Problem

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positivenumber that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

# Solution

Incrementing a test value until you reach the correct number isn't as practical since the result ends up being in the hundreds of millions.

My initial approach was to start the product of 1 and multiply it by the prime factors it was missing from each number 1 to 20.
This ended up with a runtime of ~35 μs.

Another approach I thought of was to start with a product of all the primes 1 to 20, then check if all the numbers can evenly divide it, if they can't then increase by that originial product of primes.
Average time is ~30 μs when initialized with the product of primes but is ~60 μs if it needs to find the primes itself.
