# Problem

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

# Solution

A trivial optimization we can make is excluding 2 from the primes we check, given the number is not divisible by 2.
This isn't anything powerful but it does make the code slightly cleaner.

Next is increasing the prime we're testing by 2 each time since no even numbers other than 2 are prime.

After that, if a factor is found, it gets stored as the largest factor and the search for factors continues at that value.
There's no need to start over since we know every lower number would have already been accounted for.

Each time we find a factor, we divide it from the value.
If the value is 1 following this division, we can stop checking.
