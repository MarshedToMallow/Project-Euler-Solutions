# Problem

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get and 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# Solution

**Trivial**

We can simply iterate over all values from 1 to 999, checking if they are divisible by 3 or 5.

**Increasing Pair (Attempt 1)**

A more optimized implementation is to have two variables; count_3 and count_5.
Take the smaller of the two and add it to the total, then increase it by the corresponding amount.
If both count_3 and count_5 are equal then increase both.
Keep going until both of them are at least 1000.

This means that the only values visited are those which are divisible by 3 or 5.
