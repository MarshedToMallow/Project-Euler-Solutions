# Problem

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10001st prime number?

# Solution

**Trivial (Attempt 1)**

Starting with the count at 1 and the number at 3, check if the number is prime (test divisibility against every value 2 to sqrt(number)) and increment the prime count if it is.

Each iteration, add 2 to the number and stop iterating when the prime count is 10,001.
