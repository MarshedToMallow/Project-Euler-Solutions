# Problem

A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Solution

**Trivial**

A trivial solution is to iterate over all possible products and save the largest product you see.
This has you checking every single value, which certainly isn't the best possible speed.

**Decreasing Products (Attempt 1)**

We could make a list of all the products and subtract their index (plus an offset) from the product each time it is used.
Then, each iteration we simply take the largest value and check that.
This turns out to be quite fast, taking only ~40 ms.

I also tried to continue subtracting from the last checked product until it was a palindrome (or 0), but that ended up doing a lot of extra work.

**Palindrome Iteration (Attempt 2)**

Following that, I tried iterating over the possible palindromes and checking whether they had 3 digit factors.
By only checking from 999 to the root of the palindrome, it was significantly faster than the previous approach, taking only ~0.75 ms.
