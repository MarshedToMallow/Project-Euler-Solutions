# Project-Euler-Solutions
My solutions to the first 100 Project Euler problems.

If you notice any inaccuracies with the code or explanations, feel free to make an issue or even a pull request.

## Disclaimer
I strongly urge those who haven't solved the problems to attempt them yourself.
The point of these problems is to work them out yourself and it's best to avoid just looking at the answer.
If you've already finished but want my code or insight, I encourage you to have a look.

## File Format
The explanation files include the problem statement along with solutions I identified.
Each solution is either marked as trivial or given a name and an attempt.

As for the actual code, each attempt in the explanation has a corresponding file.
Additionally, the code will have comments I felt were useful in conveying the algorithms used and the approach taken.
